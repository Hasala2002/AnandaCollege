        The Sati Pasala Foundation aims in sharing Mindfulness with school and
        university communities. It is a non-profit organization
        which is non-income generating, volunteer based and is entirely managed through donor
        funding. It is free from ethnic, religious and political dimensions, and promotes unity and
        harmony amongst all communities and people.

The practice of Mindfulness is broadly popular and has been integrated into the Education system
across the western world in developed countries. Sati Pasala Foundation is focused at establishing
Mindfulness in Sri Lanka in a formal and a systematic manner. The Program which was
initiated in 2016 has introduced Mindfulness to 10% of the schools across the Island within the
last 5 years. The Sati Pasala Mindfulness Initiative was
officially endorsed for incorporation into the State Education Curriculum on the 3rd of February, at
the Kularatne Hall, Ananda College by the Hon Minister of Education.
The Spiritual Advisor and Founder of Sati Pasala, Chief Abbot of Mitirigala Nissarana
Vanya Monastery Most Venerable Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva Maha Thero ,Hon.
Minister of Education Prof. G L Peiris, Minister of State Education Reform, Distance Education Promotion Mr. Susil Premajayantha, Secretary
to the Ministry of Education Prof. Kapila Perera and many other distinguished guests including
the Principal of Ananda College participated for this inaugural event.
The event was a huge success with the
commitment by the Sati Pasala team and the
much-valued cooperation of Ananda College
Principal, teachers, team of prefects and other
school authorities.
The respective selection of Ananda College
for this important inauguration comes with
great significance, as a school which is a
pride for the country and having a history of
great achievements and monumental value for
the entire nation. Furthermore, as some key
members of the Executive Committee of the
Sati Pasala Foundation are outstanding past
pupils of Ananda College, it made the choice
more appropriate for the launch event.

        My memory goes back to one fateful day in 1964,
when I first met Colonel Rajapakse. I remember him
as a tall and handsome person with a commanding
personality. He was the Vice Principal of Ananda
College at the time. Yet didn’t he have a personality
that could shame the Vice-Chancellor of any leading
university?
I had gone to Colombo from our home in Badulla
with my mother, expecting the results of the GCE
(O.L.) examination. I had received five distinctions,
four of which were for Physics, Chemistry, Applied
Mathematics, and Pure mathematics. Since this
result was somewhat rare at the time (and obtained
without private tuition), after enjoying a sumptuous
meal with my favorite prawn fry, which my mother
had bought me, we headed to Royal College. The
Principal, after carefully studying my examination
results and various certificates (some of which were
for extracurricular activities and sports), reluctantly
agreed to take me in (those days, the principal
had the discretion to admit students). My mother
pleaded with the principal to give me a place in the
school hostel, as that was a major condition from
her for me, to study in Colombo. That request not
materializing (to my great fortune, in hindsight), we
decided to head for Ananda College. I had never set
foot to the premises of Ananda before, yet I knew that
Ananda had achieved top results at G.C.E. (A.L.) in
the mathematics stream. I still recall the markedly
peaceful, pleasant, and contrasting environment of
the school even though it was located in the buzzling
Maradana. Unfortunately, the response that we
received from the principal of Ananda was similar to
the previous one. Highly disappointed, my mother
and I slowly walked out of the principal’s office.
There was another person in that office. He had the
physical features and the stature of a commander
of the armed forces yet a face symbolizing human
kindness. “Please wait one minute,” he told us and
walked out. He returned in about ten minutes, which
felt like a lifetime. With a smiling face he told my
mother, “Okay, I found a place in the hostel for your
son. But you will have to bring a mattress!” On that
day, this remarkable person showed us the true
nature of human compassion and care. Certainly
Col. Rajapakse did not have to help me like that,
which became a pivotal moment in my life.
Col. Rajapakse possessed the innate talent and ability
to recognize the diverse capabilities of students,
and guide them appropriately in proper directions.
Even though he was a great patriot who nurtured
and supported our armed forces (he led the cadet
platoon of the college to major victories as early as
1949, and nourished many personalities including
generals toward remarkable careers in the military
through his activities and leadership at Ananda),
he did not blindly encourage the Anandians to join
the armed forces. For example, when I planned to
apply to the Airforce without completing my GCE
(A.L.), he vehemently opposed it. He flatly told me,
“Governor, don’t be foolish. Before you find a job,
go to university and get a degree. I am not going
to give you any certificates for your application!”
From the time I imitated the “throne speech” at a
school function, Col. Rajapakse addressed me as
“Governor.”

        Qatar is home to a significant Sri Lankan expatriate
community across all walks of life. In 2012, a group
of people with a shared interest took an initiative to
form a group with a view inculcate camaraderie to
make life away from home a tad more comfortable
and to serve their alma mater in whatever way
possible. That was the humble beginnings of Ananda
College - OBA Qatar Wing. As the story goes, In
March 2012 a group of 11 Old Anandians gathered
to discuss the initiative which came in to fruition. The
first AGM was held in May 2012 and the group Old
Anandians in Qatar was formed under the wings of
the Ananda College Old Boy’s Association. Among
the founding members there were 4 senior Old
Anandians representing 68 & 77 groups. Incumbent
secretary of OBA that time, Mr. Sujeewa Rathmahal
was invited for the inauguration to represent the main
OBA.
Wasting no time as encouraged by the college
motto; group went on to organize the first ‘’Battle
of the Maroons’’ in Qatar in 2013, which ultimately
became the pinnacle of the events organized by
the Maroons in Qatar. As a tradition, distinguished
National Cricketers from both Ananda and Nalanda
were invited every year to grace the encounter. As
a small fraternity out of the country, we were truly
humbled to have Sri Lankan cricketing stalwarts
Arjuna Ranatunga, Roshan Mahanama, Sidath
Wettamuny, Mahela Jayawardene, Brendon Kuruppu
and Bandula Warnapura at these events over the past
few years.
Over the period of past nine years Ananda College –
OBA Qatar Wing contributed in numerous ways for
the betterment of the college infrastructure/sports
as well as the wellbeing of the students who were
not so fortunate with their finances. We contributed
handsomely towards the ‘Ananda Vihara Restoration
Project’ in 2014 and funded equipment purchases for
the college Hockey Team and Life Savings Club on
subsequent years. In addition, 2 scholarships were
arranged for the students with financial difficulties.

        The English Drama Circle of Ananda College is
one of the most accomplished and lauded drama
societies at school-level in Sri Lanka today. Since
its founding it has surmounted many challenges,
overturned several prejudices, and helped mould
some of the most dynamic and cosmopolitan
Anandians to emerge from school in recent years.
The Drama Circle was founded in 2006 on the
initiative of then Principal Mr. B. A. Abeyratne with
Mr. R. R. Rohana as Master in Charge and Old
Anandian Nishantha de Silva as volunteer Director.
Its initial aim was to ensure that Ananda would
consistently take part in the Annual Inter School
Shakespeare Drama Competition, which the school
had only entered a few times in the 1970s and 1980s,
and only once in the 1990s.
It took many years for the Drama Circle to find its
way. Myriad obstacles abounded, from internal
difficulties such as lack of funding, rehearsal spaces
and lukewarm support from the staff, to external
challenges including prejudice in the pseudo-elite
bastions of English drama in Colombo society.
To illustrate: in 2011, the first time Ananda entered
the Shakespeare Drama Competition final (with
a “localised” Taming of the Shrew replete with
traditional costumes and a Kopi Kade soundtrack)
the last week of rehearsal nearly didn’t happen. The
Kularatne Hall, booked by the Drama Circle weeks in
advance, was rented out to a private party at the last
minute with no prior notice. After a mad scramble to
find rehearsal venues, Ananda emerged 2nd Runners
Up. However, Letters to the Editor published in
English newspapers that same week were quick to
criticise the play’s Sri Lankan setting and ask if local
audiences would tolerate Maname being performed
in Top Hats!

        Two numbers emerge whenever there is a
debate about the proficiency of English in Sri
Lanka; five per cent and ninety-five per cent.
The former represents the percentage who are
proficient and the latter, the percentage who
are not. The divide between the vernacular and
the English language is a social construct. Its
origin is attributable to the overarching policy
of the British colonizers. In Lord Acton's words
"We have to accomplish a change both in the
State and in Society to supersede the traditional
government and the traditional civilization.
Indian culture, though it was developed, by the
same Aryan race to which our civilization is
indebted, has been arrested in its progress. The
religion and manners of the Orientals mutually
support one another; neither can be changed
without the other. Hence the pioneer of
civilization has to get rid of the religion of India,
to enable him to introduce a better culture."
The overarching objective, therefore, was to
choke the life of local traditions, religions, and
language by laws and administrative changes.
The British achieved these objectives to a
greater degree in Sri Lanka than in India. To
this end, the British used the English language
as an instrument, and English education was
conditional upon loyalty to European values.
The result was the emergence of the brown
"Pukka Sahib" culture. After the independence
of Ceylon, these brown Pukka Sahib men
influenced by European culture exacerbated
the divide to make English an exclusive tool of
few local elites. Today what prevents English
from being a personalised tool of local elites
is a few schools dedicated to educating the
underprivileged.
